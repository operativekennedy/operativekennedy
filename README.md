- Read our rentry for everything if you'd like, all our of our interests and such are in there. It's in the links.
"operativekennedy" is Leon exclusive.
"Pandemoniums" is our system and overall Pony Town related strawpage.

PLEASE READ: 
We reiterate this in every link provided but I'm going to reiterate it here as well, we're medically recognized as a system and have been for the past 8 years. Not by one but various doctors, and are currently on the road to a full diagnosis. Being on a Pony game and not being ashamed of our disorder to the point of hiding it constantly doesn't automatically invalidate our struggles and existence entirely. If you truly think someone is faking a disorder because they're open about having one or play video games online you have bigger personal issues to figure out.
